================================
1.) Make sure you have Ollama(pull a model) & python / pip installed 
2.) Run 'AI Counsel.bat' as an administrator
3.) Open your web browser and go to localhost:5000
4.) Sometimes server(app.py) gets stuck from too many HTTP requests. 
	(press any key in the terminal to push it along although.. 
	When it gets stuck the bots can start to halucinate & lose context..)
